// A checkpoint makes a group of writes all or nothing. Taken before the
// first write, it can roll the document back to that moment. It is exact for
// writes that add: new objects, entries appended to a recorded page's
// /Annots, and changes to the dictionaries every page shares that appearance
// writers touch, which it records: the catalog (it gains an /AcroForm) and
// the form dictionary with its /DR and /DR /Font. A change to any other
// object that existed when it was taken is undone only when that object was
// recorded first, with EPDFDoc_CheckpointObject().
//
// On a layer document, an object a write promoted into the layer stays
// promoted after a rollback, holding its base value: saves and "changed
// since load" are the same as before the writes.
